# Project Overview: Heart Disease Prediction Using Multiple Machine Learning Models
## 1. Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes, which makes predictive modeling essential. This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease based on various medical and demographic features using multiple machine learning models. By comparing the performance of different models, the project seeks to determine which algorithm offers the best accuracy for this classification task.

## 2. Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains features such as age, gender (Sex), chest pain type, resting ECG results, exercise-induced angina, and other medical indicators that affect heart health. The target variable is whether or not the patient has heart disease (HeartDisease), which is a binary outcome.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
Before training the machine learning models, it is important to clean and preprocess the data:

### Label Encoding: 
The dataset contains categorical variables (e.g., Sex, ChestPainType, RestingECG, ExerciseAngina, ST_Slope) that need to be converted into numerical values for machine learning models to process them. Label encoding transforms these non-numeric values into numeric codes (e.g., Male = 1, Female = 0 for Sex). This step ensures that all features are in a format compatible with the models.
### Feature Selection: 
The target variable, HeartDisease, is separated from the input features. All other columns are considered as predictors of heart disease and will be used by the models to make predictions.

## 4. Data Splitting
To evaluate the performance of the models, the dataset is divided into two parts:
### Training Set (80%): 
This set is used to train the models and learn the patterns in the data.
### Testing Set (20%): 
This set is reserved to test the models’ performance. By holding out this data, we can assess how well the models generalize to unseen data.
The split ensures that the models are not simply memorizing the data but are capable of making accurate predictions on new data.

## 5. Model Training and Evaluation
### a) Naive Bayes
#### Algorithm Overview: 
Naive Bayes is a simple, yet effective, probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the target variable. Despite this assumption, Naive Bayes often performs well in classification tasks.
#### Training: 
The Naive Bayes model is trained using the training data to calculate the conditional probabilities of the features.
#### Prediction: 
After training, the model makes predictions on the test set.
#### Evaluation: 
The model’s accuracy is measured by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels in the test set.

### b) Support Vector Machine (SVM)
#### Algorithm Overview: 
SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes. A linear kernel is used in this case.
#### Training: 
The SVM model is trained on the training data, learning to find a decision boundary that separates the data points.
#### Prediction: 
The model predicts the class (heart disease or no heart disease) for each instance in the test set.
#### Evaluation: 
The accuracy of the model is calculated to see how well it predicts heart disease.

### c) Logistic Regression
#### Algorithm Overview: 
Logistic Regression is a statistical method for binary classification. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic function.
#### Training: 
The model is trained to fit the logistic function to the data, learning the coefficients that best explain the relationship between the features and the target variable.
#### Prediction: 
After training, the model generates probability scores, and the threshold (usually 0.5) is used to classify the test data.
#### Evaluation: 
The accuracy score is computed by comparing the predicted results with the actual outcomes.

### d) Random Forest
#### Algorithm Overview: 
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions. It reduces overfitting and increases predictive accuracy by averaging the outcomes of many weak learners (decision trees).
#### Training: 
The model is trained on the training data by building multiple decision trees using different subsets of data and features.
#### Prediction: 
The Random Forest model makes predictions by averaging the results from all decision trees.
#### Evaluation: 
The accuracy score is calculated to assess the model’s performance on the test data.

## 6. Model Evaluation and Accuracy Comparison
After each model is trained and predictions are made on the test set, the accuracy scores are calculated. Accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model:

### Naive Bayes Accuracy: 
Reflects how well the probabilistic model performed based on its assumption of feature independence.
### SVM Accuracy: 
Shows how effectively the SVM model was able to find the optimal decision boundary between classes.
### Logistic Regression Accuracy: 
Indicates how well the regression model fits the data and predicts heart disease.
### Random Forest Accuracy: 
Represents the combined strength of multiple decision trees in classifying the data accurately.

## By comparing these accuracy scores, the project identifies the model that provides the most accurate heart disease predictions.

## 7. Conclusion
This project successfully applies and evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict heart disease. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and the accuracy comparison helps determine which model is best suited for this dataset. The findings of this project can be applied to other medical datasets to enhance predictive healthcare models.
